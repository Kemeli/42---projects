Those are the first 3 projects from the phase-one of 42sp school

○ The ```libft``` is about recreating useful functions from C standard library

○ The ```gnl``` is about creating a function that reads a text line by line while going deeper to valgrind and gdb
 
◘ Valgrind: programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.

◘ Gdb: debugger for C (and C++).

○ The ```ft_printf``` is about recreating the function printf from stdio.h while learning about variadic function
and hexadecimal conversions.

All of those functions are useful for the next projects as I should always use what I've coded myself
